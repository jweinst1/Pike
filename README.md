#Pike

Pike is a micro-programming language based heavily on the use of operators, and streamlining processes through symbolic commands.
For example, in Pike, instead of using `var x = 9`, you can use the short hand assignment operator `x :> 9`. Pike thrives on the philosophy of high level
syntax and simplicity. Since it is transcompiled to Javascript, you can use Pike as a superset of javascript, allowing you to mix in what you want!
